# Brief Overview
To run the program, simply run the code in `main.py`. 

There are two reinforcement learning algorithm (REINFORCE and actor-critic) implemented in `rl_algo.py`.'

The policy approximation modules are implemented in `pi_approx.py`. There are two modules, one using neural network 
and one using Fourier basis function approximation.

The value approximation modules are implemented in `value_approx.py`. There are two modules, one using neural network
and one using Fourier basis function approximation.

The genetic algorithm is implemented in `genetic_algo.py`.
